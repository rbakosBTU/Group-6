  <h1>About Us</h1>

<p style="line-height: 200%;"> 
  CHARGERS officially started in the year December 25, 2020 as an University research project by the students of BTU at Colab Research unit. 
  We inaugrated our business start-up with a group of five members in September 01,2021 and our concept focused on smart shoes which generate
  electricity that is stored in a battery while walking. The curiosity was to let the users dive into a new experiment with us, get inspired,
  and experience something new, unusual and that is helpful every day. Our main goal is to make our users have fully charged mobile batteries 
  with them anytime, anywhere and at anyplace with a minimal or no use use of electricity to charge the battery. The shoe has a pedometer and 
  a location sensor that helps users to tracke their footsteps. Our smart shoe is a multi-purpose shoe which can be used for fitness, as a 
  tracker as well as for charging the mobile phone. Additionaly good news for our user is that we also customize 
  our product in their own shoes which are very budget friendly. Currently we are offering only Cash on Delivery option soon our customers will hear something positive with
  the payment methods.
  </br></br>
  We currently have our headquaters in Cottbus, Germany with around 10-25 employees and also looking for representatives to franchise our 
  start-up abroad as well as in various parts of Germany. The aim of creating a website for CHARGERS is to bring the users close to us so that they can contact us
  directly and give us open feedbacks, shop from our direct stores instead of shopping through Third-Party sites. Additionaly we appreciate young students to
  bring open proposals for the enhancement of CHARGERS who have 95% of chances to be taken by us.
