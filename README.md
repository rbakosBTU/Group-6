### Establishment of CHARGERS:
    CHARGERS officially started in the year December 25, 2020 as an University research project by the students of BTU at Colab Research unit. 
    We inaugrated our business start-up with a group of five members in September 01,2021 and our concept focused on smart shoes which generate
    electricity that is stored in a battery while walking. The curiosity was to let the users dive into a new experiment with us, get inspired,
    and experience something new, unusual and that is helpful every day. Our main goal/mission was to make our users have fully charged mobile batteries 
    with them anytime, anywhere and at anyplace with a minimal/no use use of electricity to charge the battery. Additionaly good news for our user is that we also customize 
    our product in their own shoes which are very budget friendly. Currently we are offering only Cash on Delivery option soon our customers will hear something positive with
    the payment methods.
    
    We currently have our headquaters in Cottbus, Germany with around 10-25 employees and also looking for representatives to franchise our 
    start-up abroad as well as in various parts of Germany. The aim of creating a website for CHARGERS is to bring the users close to us so that they can contact us
    directly and give us open feedbacks, shop from our direct stores instead of shopping through Third-Party sites. Additionaly we appreciate young students to
    bring open proposals for the enhancement of CHARGERS who have 95% of chances to be taken by us.

#### For Developer understanding:
* Our product is a smart shoe that generates electricity through movement which is stored in a mobile battery which will be useful for the users to carry the battery attached to the shoe
    anywhere the user wants without searching for sockets and take chargers along with them. The shoe has a pedometer and a location sensor that helps users to tracke their footsteps. 
    Our smart shoe is a multi-purpose shoe which can be used for fitness, as a tracker as well as for charging the mobile phone. We like to have a store in our website which offer 
    different models of shoes it can be casual, formal, sporty etc., for men, women and children. Also the slogan to be added for our website which will be as follows and, this
    slogan is to be added as a crawler(TOP) it should start repeating after the last letter ends.
