### Establishment of CHARGERS:
    CHARGERS officially started in the year December 25, 2020 as an University research project by the students of BTU at Colab Research unit. 
    We inaugrated our business start-up with a group of five members in September 01,2021 and our concept focused on smart shoes which generate
    electricity that is stored in a battery while walking. The curiosity was to let the users dive into a new experiment with us, get inspired,
    and experience something new, unusual and that is helpful every day. Our main goal was to make our users have fully charged mobile battery 
    with them anytime, anywhere and at anyplace with a minimal/no use use of electricity. 
    
    We currently have our headquaters in Cottbus, Germany with around 10-25 employees and also looking for representatives to franchise our 
    start-up abroad. The aim of creating a website for CHARGERS is to bring the users close to us so that they can contact us directly and 
    give us open feedbacks, shop from our direct stores instead of shopping through Third-Party sites. Additionaly we appreciate young students to
    bring open proposals for the enhancement of CHARGERS who have 95% of chances to be taken by us.
